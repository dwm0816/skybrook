            The Skybrook foundation for sarcoidosis awareness is a small organization dedicated to raising awareness for sarcoidosis, and help victims of sarcoidosis and their families with the potential fallout of the disease.
            <br><br>The foundation was founded in spring of 2017 by cofounders Jeffery Dupuy, a long time sufferer of Sarcoidosis, David McKissick and Phillip Lambert.
            <br><br>
            The foundation was ultimately formed with the goal of global education and awareness of the disease thru long term awareness campaigns across the globe. As of now we are planning a campaign for schools across the country
            distributing materials teaching the basics of Sarcoidosis, how to spot it, and how it is treated.
