        <h3>How is Sarcoidosis treated?</h3>
        <p class="contentCell">Sarcoidosis is a relatively difficult disease to diagnose, and as such, has less than ideal treatments as of right now. The most common treatments for Sarcoidosis consist of the following: Administration of various medications such as Immunosuppressants including Methetrexate, Hydroxychloroquine and Azathioprene, TNF-Alpha Inhibitors and Corticosteroids.
          Surgery and radiation on affected tissue is still practiced mostly in the US and UK regions with controversial levels of success.</p>

        <h3>I believe I may have Sarcoidosis? What do I do?</h3>
        <p class="contentCell">The first step is to schedule an appointment with your doctor. In most cases testing will include things such as a chest X-Ray, Bloodwork, Examinations of your skin (Searching for bumps and lesions), A lymphatic examination, Lung function tests and, in more complete exams, a biopsy wherein your doctor will take a small snippet of flesh from inside your lung for testing. As well as all of these, PET Scans and internal 3D imaging may be used to complete the diagnosis.</p>
