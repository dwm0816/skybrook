          <p class="storyContent">Hello, and thank you for taking the time to read this! <br><br>Today we are happy to announce our incipient launch.<br>We have been taking our time to ensure everything is ready for our official launch, and finally, we believe we are prepared. So today we would like to share the road ahead and the plans we have for achieving our goals.<br><br>First, we will need funding to get the materials into the hands of students, professionals and anyone else we can reach as smoothly as possible. This is our first step in opening a more globalized dialogue about Sarcoidosis. After this initial campaign of awareness, we would ideally like to launch a campaign beginning in the united states to get more sarcoid related information and material added into textbooks and disease manuals in colleges and medical technical schools.<br>Our reasoning for this is simple, we believe the education system would ultimately result in a more complete awareness than our admittedly small organization can achieve alone. In adding Sarcoidosis materials to schools, we believe it will result in a more wide and open dialogue about the disease and the implications of said disease.<br><br>After our initial campaigns, we would like to begin offering member services. This includes things ranging from the extremely simple such as emotional and mental support to things more complex, in the future, such as monetary support for special cases.<br>Ultimately we have many plans but they all boil down to a simple trinity. <br><br>Awareness, Assistance, Research.<br><br>In this trinity we believe Sarcoid can finally be brought out of the shadows and shown the seriousness and awareness found in other, equally terrible diseases.</p>
