*= results in multiplying then assigning the multiplied number to the variable (EG x=4; x *= 4, x now equals 16)<br>
/= results in the same as *= but via division. <br>
------------------------------------------
x++ or ++x // same as x = x + 1
x-- or --x // same as x = x - 1
x += 3 // same as x = x + 3
x -= 6 // same as x = x - 6
x *= 2 // same as x = x * 2
x /= 5 // same as x = x / 5
------------------------------------------=

var donuts = ["jelly donut", "chocolate donut", "glazed donut"];

// the variable `i` is used to step through each element in the array
for (var i = 0; i < donuts.length; i++) {
    donuts[i] += " hole";
    donuts[i] = donuts[i].toUpperCase();
}

java array loop reminder
Note to self: 15.19. Inline array loop <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
In case I forget:
var donuts = ["jelly donut", "chocolate donut", "glazed donut"];

donuts.forEach(function(donut) {
  donut += " hole";
  donut = donut.toUpperCase();
  console.log(donut);
});
(The program does love its donuts...)
muffins too.
