        <p class="contentCell">The Skybrook Foundation was founded in 2017 with the goal of spreading awareness and assisting in the funding of research for sarcoidosis. We offer member services, healthcare provider informative materials, and family assistance for sufferers and their families. Skybrook is a nonprofit organization in the field of sarcoidosis research and awareness based out of Montana with the ultimate goal of lifting the shroud surrounding this disease and the trials sufferers of the ailment must overcome on a daily basis.</p>
